3D Cube Shell Animation

Simple and fun shell animation inspired by the [YouTube video by servetgulnaroglu.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p09i_hoFdd0).

While inspired by the aforementioned shell animation, I have made a few significant differences to add some extra colors, effects, shapes, etc.

Additional changes have been made to make some of the code a bit more elegant and efficient. At least I hope they have. Maybe I made it worse. Either way, still a fun little project.

Figured this would be an interesting way to practice writing in C.
