3D Cube Shell Animation

Simple and fun shell animation inspired by the [YouTube video by servetgulnaroglu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p09i_hoFdd0).

While inspired by the aforementioned shell animation, I have made a few significant differences to add some extra colors, effects, shapes, etc.

Additional changes have been made to fit my personal style preferences. Some of these may make it more or less efficient or elegant. Not really aiming to make the original better, but rather just some personal preference.

Figured this would be an interesting way to practice writing C.
